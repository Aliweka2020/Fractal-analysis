# Fractal-analysis
# Overview

Fractal Analysis is a computational tool for analyzing fractal properties of datasets, images, and signals. It calculates key fractal metrics such as fractal dimension, self-similarity, and complexity, aiding in research. This is an automated Python script designed to execute preparation processes for dental radiography pictures automatically, as opposed to the time-consuming manual ImageJ tool.
